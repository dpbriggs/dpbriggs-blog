** Running the website locally (development)

Running the website locally is pretty easy, thanks to =cargo= and =rustup=.

1. Be sure you have [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]] to install a nightly toolchain.
2. Install a nightly toolchain =rustup toolchain add nightly=
3. Set nightly as your default toolchain =rustup default nightly=
4. Clone and enter the project =git clone git@github.com:dpbriggs/dpbriggs-blog.git && cd dpbriggs-blog=
5. Run the project =cargo run=
6. (optional) rename the project (replace =myname= with whatever you want):
   - =mv dpbriggs-blog myname-blog=
   - Edit =Cargo.toml= and change instances of =dpbriggs= in there to =myname=
   - Edit =src/main.rs= and update the default site context.
