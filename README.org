This repository holds my personal website [[https://dpbriggs.ca][dpbriggs.ca]].


Feel free to fork and modify this website. Please note this website
is under GPLv3 so be sure to keep the license and attribute.


Built with:
- [[https://rocket.rs/][Rocket]] ðŸš€ (Rust Web Framework)
- [[https://github.com/Keats/tera][Tera]] (Fast templating language/engine, similar to Jinja2)
- [[https://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]] (CSS framework)


** Running the website locally (development)

Running the website locally is pretty easy, thanks to =cargo= and =rustup=.

1. Be sure you have [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]] to install a nightly toolchain.
2. Install a nightly toolchain =rustup toolchain add nightly=
3. Set nightly as your default toolchain =rustup default nightly=
4. Clone and enter the project =git clone git@github.com:dpbriggs/dpbriggs-blog.git && cd dpbriggs-blog=
5. Run the project =cargo run=
6. (optional) rename the project (replace =myname= with whatever you want):
   - =mv dpbriggs-blog myname-blog=
   - Edit =Cargo.toml= and change instances of =dpbriggs= in there to =myname=
   - Edit =src/context.rs= and update the default site context.

Alternatively, use the make file:

#+begin_example
make watch # live-reload
make test  # run tests
#+end_example

** Deploying the website

As is tradition, we need several ways to build the website.
The server which runs my website is running a stable version of Ubuntu, and my arch system
has a relatively new version of Glibc. It's no longer possible for me to run =make_package.sh=
and upload the artifacts.

So I added a quick docker container which will generate the build artifacts.

*** Using docker

To build the container:

#+begin_example
  cd docker
  docker build . -t blog-maker
#+end_example

This will setup a container with rust running ubuntu 18.04.

To generate a build artifact:

#+begin_example
docker run --rm -v ~/programming/dpbriggs-blog:/source blog-maker
#+end_example

This will output something like:

#+begin_example
... rust build stuff ...
Created project archive dpbriggs-blog-Aug-15-2021-06-47PM.zip in current directory.
Simply copy to server, unzip, and use:
systemctl --user restart run_site run_caddy
#+end_example

If this succeeds, you'll have a new artifact that looks like =dpbriggs-blog-Aug-15-2021-06-47PM.zip= in the repo root.

*NOTE*: This zip only builds off of the latest committed master. Some files, like =.caddy-env= will need to be copied onto the server normally.
